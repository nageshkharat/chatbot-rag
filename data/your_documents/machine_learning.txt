Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning algorithms build mathematical models based on training data to make predictions or decisions without being specifically programmed to perform the task.

There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning (learning from labeled data), unsupervised learning (finding patterns in unlabeled data), and reinforcement learning (learning through interaction with an environment).

Common machine learning algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, neural networks, and deep learning models. Machine learning is used in applications like image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and predictive analytics.
