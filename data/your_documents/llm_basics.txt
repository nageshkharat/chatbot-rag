Large Language Models (LLMs) are deep learning models trained on vast amounts of text data. They can understand and generate human-like language. Examples of LLMs include GPT, BERT, LLaMA, and Mistral.

LLMs work by learning the statistical patterns of language and generating text based on the input prompt. They are used in tasks like translation, summarization, question-answering, and chatbot development.
