FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. It is built on top of Starlette and Pydantic.

Key features of FastAPI include automatic generation of interactive API docs, input validation using Pydantic, and excellent performance comparable to Node.js and Go.

FastAPI is widely used for building backend services, including machine learning inference APIs, microservices, and data APIs.
